# Advent of Code 2017

http://adventofcode.com/2017/about

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels.
They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp
as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different
skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

# Remark

This repo only shows my solutions to the coding riddles and for training my Swift skills.
The solutions presented here are probably horribly inefficient and not elegant in any shape or form.
